## Wozniak's 20 rules (https://super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm)

Advice on creating flashcards.
Of special note:
- 1. "Do not learn if you do not understand" (context, language, prerequisites...)
- 2. "Learn before you memorize" This bears repeating: *flashcards are not a learning tool*
- 4. "The Minimum Information Principle" (Michael Nielson calls these "atomic questions" because they are semantically irreducible.)

## "Augmenting Long-Term Memory" by Michael Nielson (http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html)

An essay on the effective use of spaced-repetition. Among Nielson's theses are these:
- Spaced repetition is an instrument of memory requiring technique and practice for effective use
- Spaced repetition is not just for trivia, but for retaining hierarchical knowledge. (But the flashcards
must reflect this hierarchy in their relations.
- Per card review times should often be as low as 8 seconds.
- Memorization cannot take root in a vaccuum. It must be linked to intellectual and creative projects.
