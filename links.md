### [Piotr Wozniak's 20 Rules Of Formulating Knowledge](https://super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm)

Advice on creating flashcards.
Of special note:

1. "Do not learn if you do not understand" (context, language, prerequisites...)
2. "Learn before you memorize" This bears repeating: *flashcards are not a learning tool*
4. "The Minimum Information Principle" (Michael Nielson calls these "atomic questions" because they are semantically irreducible.)

### ["Augmenting Long-Term Memory" by Michael Nielson](http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html)

An essay on the effective use of spaced-repetition. Among Nielson's theses:

- Spaced repetition is a discipline requiring technique and practice.
- Spaced repetition is not for trivia, but for retaining hierarchical knowledge. (But only if the flashcards
reflect this hierarchy.)
- Review times can be as low as 8 seconds.
- Memorization cannot take root in a vaccuum. It must be linked to intellectual and creative projects.

### [ANKI](https://apps.ankiweb.net/)
