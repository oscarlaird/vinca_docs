<p>Advice on creating flashcards. Of special note: - 1. “Do not learn if you do not understand” (context, language, prerequisites…) - 2. “Learn before you memorize” This bears repeating: <em>flashcards are not a learning tool</em> - 4. “The Minimum Information Principle” (Michael Nielson calls these “atomic questions” because they are semantically irreducible.)</p>

<p>An essay on the effective use of spaced-repetition. Among Nielson’s theses are these: - Spaced repetition is an instrument of memory requiring technique and practice for effective use - Spaced repetition is not just for trivia, but for retaining hierarchical knowledge. (But the flashcards must reflect this hierarchy in their relations. - Per card review times should often be as low as 8 seconds. - Memorization cannot take root in a vaccuum. It must be linked to intellectual and creative projects.</p>
